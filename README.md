Simple script that programmatically switches between the default sink's Line Out and Headphone ports depending which one is in use.

Can be set to a keybind using various methods, personally I use GNOME (+ arch btw,) and thus I use the keyboard shortcut feature in GNOME Settings.

Hopefully this is as useful for you as it is me. Enjoy!
